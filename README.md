## 📊 Project Overview  
This analysis uses Metacritic data (2013–2023, 131,000+ PC games) to uncover actionable insights on how genre, release timing, and player engagement impact reception. By understanding review trends, critic-user dynamics, and publisher positioning, smaller studios can make evidence-based decisions to maximize their chances of success.
Our goal: help **small developers** compete smarter — not bigger — by making data-driven decisions.

## 🧠 Key Insights  

- **Genre matters** → Action & RPG dominate; niche genres require innovation.  
- **Timing matters** → Fall drives reviews but AAA competition is fierce.  
- **Engagement matters** → More reviews usually equal higher scores.  
- **Critics vs Users** → Both agree when games are bad; users are harsher on what’s “good.”  
- **Nuances** → Pre-release critic sentiment and art style affect how players respond.

## ✅ Recommendations  

1. 🎯 **Target genres wisely** — focus on Action/RPG or innovate in niches.  
2. ⏳ **Time releases strategically** — avoid AAA-heavy Fall; consider Spring/Winter.  
3. 🚀 **Build early engagement** — betas, influencers, and community outreach.  
4. 🛠 **Polish matters** — users are harsher than critics, so stability & UX count.  
5. 🎨 **Stand out visually** — distinctive art styles can boost recognition.
